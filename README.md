# Architect Design - Exercise Project

This is my first fully self-made website, created after finishing the third part of my web development course (Kurs Tworzenia Stron WWW, author Majek). I built this project to test and practice my skills, and to challenge myself to create a complete site independently. My next course is JavaScript, so I want to see how good my skills are in static frontend web development. 

The website showcases a fictional architecture design company, with sections like Team, Design, Offers, and Contact. This project helped me understand layout, responsive design, navigation, and basic interactivity using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript (done a lot of JavaScript with ChatGPT but i was just trying to understand how it works even though I haven't taken JavaScript course yet).  

Feel free to explore the site and give feedback. This project isn't commercial but it's primarily for learning and skill improvement.
