# Architect Design - Personal Project

This is my first fully self-made website, created as part of the third part of my web development course. I built this project to test and practice my skills, and to challenge myself to create a complete site independently.  

The website showcases a fictional architecture design company, with sections like Team, Design, Offers, and Contact. This project helped me understand layout, responsive design, navigation, and basic interactivity using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript.  

Feel free to explore the site and give feedback. This project is primarily for learning and skill improvement.
